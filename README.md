# TrafficSystem
Traffic System Multithreading Project
# How to Run

Follow these steps to compile and execute the traffic simulation program:

1. First, open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Compile the `trafficSystem.c` file using the `gcc` compiler and the `-lpthread` flag to enable pthread library:

   ```bash
   gcc -o trafficSystem trafficSystem.c -lpthread
   
3. Once the compilation is successful, execute the program by running the generated executable:
   
   ```bash
   ./trafficSystem

5. The program will prompt you to enter commands for the traffic simulation. Follow the instructions provided by the program's prompts.

6. After you have entered the required commands, the program will execute the traffic simulation.

7. During the simulation, the program will display a log showing the progression of the traffic simulation, including relevant information and updates.

8. To stop the simulation, you can use an appropriate command or follow the on-screen instructions provided by the program.

9. That's it! You have now successfully compiled, executed, and interacted with the traffic simulation program. Enjoy!
